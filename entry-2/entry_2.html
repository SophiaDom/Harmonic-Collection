    <h2>STUYVESANT PARK</h2>
    <p>Originally opening in 1850, the park had been significantly developed in the 1930s, leaving it looking very similar to its current status. The cast-iron fence has been maintained since its first opening. The trees populating this park are well over 100 years old, becoming history themselves. Over time, statues, benches, tables, and fountains were added, but the main character of these twin parks are their English Elms.</p>

<!--<p>Exploring the Concrete Jungle. I want to explore the balance between nature and infrastructure on a daily basis around the city. As I navigate the city I will upload entries of the different discoveries (views out the window where tree tops are level with rooftops, buildings with vines covering the exteriors, parks, etc.). I would like to include images as well as written entries for each. I’ve seen exercises where each day you write a few things you are grateful for to practice gratuity and this would be my format of that but specifically about the city. I’m interested to see how my experiences with the city change, how they differ from my last year in Philly or even short trips home to Connecticut. I’d like the layout to appear in a scrapbook or journal manner. I’d also like it to be mostly warm neutral tones with green. I imagine these are the colors I will find most in the images I take under this concentration and I’d like to keep them cohesive throughout the whole page.<p>-->
