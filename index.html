<!--<p>Exploring the Concrete Jungle. I want to explore the balance between nature and infrastructure on a daily basis around the city. As I navigate the city I will upload entries of the different discoveries (views out the window where tree tops are level with rooftops, buildings with vines covering the exteriors, parks, etc.). I would like to include images as well as written entries for each. I’ve seen exercises where each day you write a few things you are grateful for to practice gratuity and this would be my format of that but specifically about the city. I’m interested to see how my experiences with the city change, how they differ from my last year in Philly or even short trips home to Connecticut. I’d like the layout to appear in a scrapbook or journal manner. I’d also like it to be mostly warm neutral tones with green. I imagine these are the colors I will find most in the images I take under this concentration and I’d like to keep them cohesive throughout the whole page.<p>-->
